### üìå Project Overview

The **Chicago Crime Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Excel-based visualization created to analyze crime patterns across different years, races, and charge categories. Using Chicago‚Äôs publicly available crime dataset, the dashboard provides insights into the **number of cases filed**, **charge types**, and **demographic distribution of offenses**, helping policymakers and law enforcement better understand crime trends and enforcement focus areas.

This project demonstrates end-to-end **data preparation, transformation, and visualization** capabilities using **Microsoft Excel**, including pivot tables, charts, and interactive slicers for dynamic exploration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation

The raw dataset required multiple **data cleaning and transformation** steps before dashboard creation:

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Standardized date formats across columns (`ARREST DATE`, `DATE`).
   * Removed blank and duplicate rows.
   * Handled inconsistent race labels and missing entries.
   * Created a unified ‚ÄúCharge‚Äù field combining multiple charge descriptions.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extracted **Year** from the `DATE` column for trend analysis.
   * Created calculated fields to count **Total Cases Filed** by each statute.
   * Categorized cases by **Charge Type** (A, M, F, etc.) and **Charge Class**.

3. **Data Validation**

   * Cross-verified counts of statutes and cases filed for consistency.
   * Ensured dynamic range updates using Excel tables for scalability.

## üìä Dashboard Components

The Excel dashboard was designed using **Pivot Tables**, **Pivot Charts**, and **Slicers** for user interactivity.
It includes the following visual components:

### 1. **KPI Summary Cards**

* **Total Cases Filed**
* **Cases Filed by Charge 1‚Äì4 Statutes**

### 2. **Trend Analysis**

* **Bar Chart (Cases Filed by Year)** ‚Äì Shows year-wise distribution from 2014‚Äì2023.
* **Line Chart (Monthly Case Trend)** ‚Äì Displays case volume variation across months.

### 3. **Demographic Breakdown**

* **Donut Chart (Crimes by Race)** ‚Äì Visualizes racial distribution of reported cases.

### 4. **Top Offenses**

* **Horizontal Bar Chart (Top 10 Charges)** ‚Äì Lists the most common crimes such as:

  * *Issuance of Warrant*
  * *Driving on Suspended License*
  * *Possession of Controlled Substance*
  * *Domestic Battery ‚Äì Bodily Harm*
  * *Retail Theft*

### 5. **Interactive Filters**

* **Slicers for Year and Race** to allow multi-level filtering.
* **Dynamic charts** automatically update based on slicer selections.
